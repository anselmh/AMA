# Ask me anything

## [Ask a new question](../../issues/new) | [Read all answered questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

As I get a couple of questions via email or twitter anyways, I’m following the 
lead and will answer questions in public here.

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn‘t already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests for projects I do should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Technical support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
